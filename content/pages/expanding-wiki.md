## Important Formatting Rule(s)
### How to begin your markdown files:

```

... (Information goes here)
```

Beginning your markdown with this first chunk of text is important, especially if you want credit where credit is due. (This first section won't be displayed on the wiki page)

``` title: ``` edits the page's title on the tab 
``` description: ``` is more behinds the scenes. Has to do with SEO
``` author: ``` credits the author/editor of the page 
``` lastModified: ``` date in which the page was edited (To keep the wiki structured we will use the Month > Day > Year format **[i.e., July 3rd, 2025]**)
