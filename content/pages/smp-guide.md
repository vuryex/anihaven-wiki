## How to get started on the AniHaven SMP (Season 2)

### Gathering wood

As you have noticed, simply punching and breaking a wood log with your hand does not drop a wood log. This is an intentional feature added with the [Realistic Survival](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival) plugin. However, this does **not** mean that you're not able to gather wood at all. 

To successfully mine wood from a tree you must manage to obtain a piece of flint (usually through mining gravel) and while holding that piece of flint -- right-click a stone block a couple times to obtain a flint shard. Some flint may be faulty and won't turn into a flint shard no matter how many times you right-click so you'll have to find another piece of flint and try again. After obtaining a flint shard you'll have to obtain a stick (usually through mining leaves) \
