# How to get started on the AniHaven SMP (Season 2)

## Gathering wood

As you have noticed, simply punching and breaking a wood log with your hand does not drop a wood log. This is an intentional feature added with the [Realistic Survival](https://github.com/ValMobile/RealisticSurvival) plugin. However, this does **not** mean that you're not able to gather wood at all.

To successfully mine wood from a tree you first must manage to obtain a piece of flint (usually through mining gravel) and while holding that piece of flint left-click a stone block a couple times to obtain a flint shard.

After obtaining a flint shard you'll have to obtain a stick (usually through mining leaves). After obtaining a stick: use this crafting recipe to make a Flint Knife.

Once you've obtained a flint knife, you will now have to collect plant fibers which you will then use to make plant string.

After you've obtained one plant string, you are now able to craft a flint hatchet which would then allow you to successfully mine wood logs.
